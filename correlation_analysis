/this is an analysis for correlation step by step

initial design was to submit to the loading page



/try to investigate wanted and wanted_inputs


/loading page

what happens filters what is wanted and not needed from the submitted form data
create datasets using create_datasets
fetches genofile samplelist

/passed to show correlation object


     return value "start_vars": {
        "n_samples": 71,
        "wanted_inputs": "n_samples"
    }


create data

currently what is need in the correlation object
